 ## Why I Love Technical Writing
 As a child, I've always possessed a love of learning, and had an eagle eye for detail.
 I'm naturally logical, and I've always loved to pull things apart to figure out how to put them back together.
 I never really paid attention to the technical documentation that I utilized to help me along the way.
 However, when I began to realize that I had a passion for teaching and breaking down complex information into terms that everyone
 could understand, it became blatantly obvious to me how important these documents were. Certain things seem like they're just *there*,
 and most people don't understand that there are actual people developing these resources that we all rely on.
 
 I soon found myself trying to discover my passion. I'd always been great at math, but that wasn't what I wanted to do with my life.
 I needed creativity! I needed to express myself, and interact with others! But teaching wasn't for me, either. Working with disabled and 
 underprivileged students depleted my mental health and my energy. This is when I began to study software development and data analytics.
 
 I've dedicated hundreds of hours to studying. Between work shifts, late nights,"overnighters"... I was addicted to learning more! And there
 was so much to learn. There still is, and I am dedicated to learning.
 
 I've said all of this to express how *passionate* I really am about technical writing. It allows me to be creative (with layouts, snapshots and more)
 and continue learning about different programming languages, tech softwares and processes...while still helping others understand complex topics that they
 might've never had the opportunity or privilege to learn. :)
 
## Magical Text
In this example, I used Chartio and AWS data and metrics to create [“magical”](https://community.getmagical.com/)
text responses to improve agent phone after work time, because when it comes to customer service, speed is a sign of respect.
After creating these text responses of my own, I shared them with the rest of my organization and published this documentation
to the knowledge base so that they could create some of their own. The text shorcuts I've developed alone have saved approximately
60.5 hours of after call work time!! Not only does this allow our servicing agents to speak with more customers and work more efficiently, it helps them
out when it is time to get performance bonuses!

### Spanish Servicing
In this example, I noticed a HUGE volume of tickets in Zendesk, specifically Spanish Servicing tasks. This was significantly slowing down agent production 
time. I used Chartio and AWS metrics to support my hypothesis, pinpoint the cause, and create a Zendesk macro that would ensure that agents could efficiently 
transfer these tickets to the Spanish Speaking agents' inboxes. 

### Clear Cache and Cookies
In my current position, we have recently been in the middle of a huge software update. Prior to the launch, I was able to help the engineering teams with software testing and data migration. However, on the day of launch, there were a lot of hiccups that resulted in the servicing agents needing to clear cache and cookies as more updates were being pushed through. ["here"](ClearCache.pdf) I created a simple how-to document that would help some agents that were less technically-inclined. Prior to this, many of the agents had also cleared things like their passwords and their magical text responses!
